# **Sync**
Created by Ricardo Gra√ßa

## **Description**
Sync is a progressive web app which is used to watch youtube videos **synchronously** with your friends! 

This web app uses **Google Firebase** for the hosting and the database. It's made using **NodeJS** along with **HTMl**, **SCSS** and **JS** (**jQuery**, **jQuery UI**, **Materialize.js**). It also uses some other web API's such as the **Youtube API**, **random words API** and **adorable.io**

Using a **real time database** (similar to sockets) it's possible for users to be in sync when watching a youtube video on the same room!

This project is **still in development** with many more features that I expect to add such as **web torrenting** to allow users to stream their own content inside the rooms.

## **Development Map**
This is the steps that I followed to create the project so far:

3. Allow the users to register/login.
4. Assign them dynamically created images.
5. Assign them with their own unique user ID.
6. Add the ability for users to create and join rooms.
7. Add youtube video functionality in the room.
8. Create a chat inside the room.
9. Synchronize the video time of the video for all the users.
10. Create controls for the video.
11. **MORE COMING**
